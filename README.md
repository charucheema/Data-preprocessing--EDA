# ASSIGNMENT - 01 #

## Problem statement : ##

a) Pick a kaggle data set which might be fairly noisy.

b) Write a data cleaning and preprocessing and visualization colab using any data set.

c) You can do model training with scikit learn as well but we will not check the accuracy/performance of the model. the main focus is whether you did the right data                    cleaning.

## Solution: ##

Dataset - New york city Airbnb Dataset For Data cleaning, Data visualization, Feature Extraction and Prediction 

## Exploratory Data Analysis ##

## Data Cleaning ##
 Using Pandas and numpy Library
 
a) Removal of statistically inconsequential columns. 

b) Handling missing values in the data.

c) Identifying and removing duplicated in the data.

d) Outlier removal.
